                <h3>Final Year Project: Veterinary Management System (2024-2025)</h3>
                <p>
                    This system was developed as my Final Year Project for Tawakkal Veterinary Clinic to streamline daily operations and clinic management. 
                    It supports functionalities such as appointment scheduling, payment processing, and record management. 
                    The system was built using Java (Servlets, DAO, and Model architecture), JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    Third-party tools such as <strong>ToyyibPay</strong> were integrated for online payments, while <strong>Chart.js</strong> and <strong>FullCalendar.js</strong> were used for data visualization and calendar management respectively.

                <p>
                    This Library Management System was developed to help librarians efficiently manage library operations. 
                    The system includes features such as a login page, book borrowing and returning functionality, and an interface for adding new books. 
                    It was built using the Java MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and incorporates JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and structured user interface.

                <h3>Web-Based Interface Design: PixieScreen (2023)</h3>
                <p>
                    PixieScreen is a web-based movie streaming interface inspired by platforms like Netflix. 
                    It was developed as a group project focused solely on frontend design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    The platform features a login page, homepage, and movie browsing UI, but does not include backend functionality.
                    My part of the system is login page and tv shows page.

                <h3>Discrete Structure: Magic Square Games (2022-2023)</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is an interactive game based on the concept of a magic square, developed as part of my Discrete Structure course. 
                    A magic square is a grid where the numbers in each row, column, and both diagonals all add up to the same total. 
                    The game allows users to arrange numbers and test whether their grid forms a valid magic square. 
                    It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on logic implementation and user interaction.

                <p>
                    PetVerse is a simple web application designed to keep track of personal pet information, such as profiles, images, and details about each cat. 
                    It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean and user-friendly interface. 
                    This project focuses on front-end development and showcases a practical use of static web technologies.
